This is a small example of how you can solve the following tasks:

1. Check if two strings are anagrams (ValidAnagram)
2. Form groups of anagrams from a list of strings (GroupAnagram)

There is a small set of tests available for each of the classes.
Additionally, you can run a demo program to verify the functionality of these functions.

For running demo program please use next command in you console:
```code
gradle runDemoApp --console=plain
```
